		#BAE-tank-1000-MF-desc = This tank can contain the most popular fuels, and lots and lots of them. We don't know exactly why someone would need such a huge amount of fuel, but there it is.

		#BAE-tank-500-05-titl = BAE T5LFO05 Fuel Tank
		#BAE-tank-500-05-desc = No, it didn't fall from the storage shelf. We made it that flat, for some odd reason.

		#BAE-adapt-500-2x-titl = BAE CB5 Stack Bi-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-500-2x-desc = Make your fuel bill twice as outrageous as before with this stack-splitting bi-coupler.

		#BAE-adapt-500-3x-titl = BAE CT5 Stack Tri-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-500-3x-desc = As usual, there is nothing particularly courageous about the yellow tri-coupler, and we recommend refraining from exposing it to dangerous, or even somewhat alarming, situations.

		#BAE-adapt-500-4x-titl = BAE CQ5 Stack Quad-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-500-4x-desc = Make your large rockets even larger with the 5m quad coupler. A few struts here and there should keep unplanned rapid disassembly at bay.

		#BAE-adapt-750-2x-titl = BAE CB7 Stack Bi-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-750-2x-desc = Think big! And in the case of our 7.5m bi-coupler, think ridiculously big!

		#BAE-adapt-750-3x-titl = BAE CT7 Stack Tri-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-750-3x-desc = Constructed with the aid of our new intelligent welding robots, the 7.5m tri-coupler ought to be safer than ever. Then again, none of them passed Rocket Science 101.

		#BAE-adapt-750-4x-titl = BAE CQ7 Stack Quad-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-750-4x-desc = A 7.5m quad-coupler! The responsible design engineers have already been moved to more appropriate, rubber-padded accommodations.

	// Parts\Utility
		#BAE-chute-250-titl = BAE PR2 Radial Parachute
		#BAE-chute-250-desc = With five times the effective diameter of the Mk2-R, the BAE PR2 Will help you land those heavy boosters safely back on Kerbin. Try not to land them on top of the VAB, though; it's such a hassle to get them down from there!

		#BAE-chute-375-titl = BAE PR3 Radial Parachute
		#BAE-chute-375-desc = More than seven times the effective diameter of the Mk2-R means less scrap metal and more reusable parts returning to the surface. That can't be good for Jebediah's junkyard business.

		#BAE-chute-500-titl = BAE PR5 Radial Parachute
		#BAE-chute-500-desc = A parachute, almost ten times the effective diameter of the Mk2-R. Better make sure something heavy is on the other end, or it will be years before it lands!

		#BAE-leg-800-titl = BAE LL8 8m Landing Leg
		#BAE-leg-800-desc = A rather tall landing leg that will ensure ground clearance for the Ajax engines. Why you would even want to land something big enough to have an Ajax engine anywhere is a mystery to us, but there it is.
