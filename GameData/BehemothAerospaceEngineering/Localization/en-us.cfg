		#BAE-eng-500-B1-desc = With a fuel pump that could launch medium sized payloads into orbit without igniting the fuel, this enormous engine is what you'll need for those times when enough just isn't enough. Not for use as an upper stage engine, or when fuel economy is an issue.

		#BAE-eng-750-A2-titl = BAE A2 "Ajax II" Extremely Heavy Engine
		#BAE-eng-750-A2-desc = Two engines in one is pretty cool and, if our math is correct, means you get twice the thrust of the Ajax engine.

		#BAE-eng-750-B2-titl = BAE B2 "Boss II" Extremely Heavy Lift Engine
		#BAE-eng-750-B2-desc = With twice the thrust of the 'Boss' engine, this lower stage engine will haul your oversized payloads into space almost before you can say 'zero'. Comes with the same fuel efficiency as its younger sibling.

		#BAE-tank-1000-MF-titl = BAE T10MF2 Multi-Fuel Tank
		#BAE-tank-1000-MF-desc = This tank can contain the most popular fuels, and lots and lots of them. We don't know exactly why someone would need such a huge amount of fuel, but there it is.

		#BAE-tank-500-05-titl = BAE T5LFO05 Fuel Tank
		#BAE-tank-500-05-desc = No, it didn't fall from the storage shelf. We made it that flat, for some odd reason.

		#BAE-adapt-500-3x-desc = As usual, there is nothing particularly courageous about the yellow tri-coupler, and we recommend refraining from exposing it to dangerous, or even somewhat alarming, situations.

		#BAE-adapt-500-4x-titl = BAE CQ5 Stack Quad-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-500-4x-desc = Make your large rockets even larger with the 5m quad coupler. A few struts here and there should keep unplanned rapid disassembly at bay.

		#BAE-adapt-750-2x-titl = BAE CB7 Stack Bi-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-750-2x-desc = Think big! And in the case of our 7.5m bi-coupler, think ridiculously big!

		#BAE-adapt-750-3x-titl = BAE CT7 Stack Tri-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-750-3x-desc = Constructed with the aid of our new intelligent welding robots, the 7.5m tri-coupler ought to be safer than ever. Then again, none of them passed Rocket Science 101.

		#BAE-adapt-750-4x-titl = BAE CQ7 Stack Quad-Coupler
		#BAE-adapt-750-4x-desc = A 7.5m quad-coupler! The responsible design engineers have already been moved to more appropriate, rubber-padded accommodations.

	// Parts\Utility
		#BAE-chute-250-titl = BAE PR2 Radial Parachute
		#BAE-chute-250-desc = With five times the effective diameter of the Mk2-R, the BAE PR2 Will help you land those heavy boosters safely back on Kerbin. Try not to land them on top of the VAB, though; it's such a hassle to get them down from there!

		#BAE-chute-375-titl = BAE PR3 Radial Parachute
		#BAE-chute-375-desc = More than seven times the effective diameter of the Mk2-R means less scrap metal and more reusable parts returning to the surface. That can't be good for Jebediah's junkyard business.

		#BAE-chute-500-titl = BAE PR5 Radial Parachute
		#BAE-chute-500-desc = A parachute, almost ten times the effective diameter of the Mk2-R. Better make sure something heavy is on the other end, or it will be years before it lands!

		#BAE-leg-800-titl = BAE LL8 8m Landing Leg
		#BAE-leg-800-desc = A rather tall landing leg that will ensure ground clearance for the Ajax engines. Why you would even want to land something big enough to have an Ajax engine anywhere is a mystery to us, but there it is.
